# DnD Character Creation Tool

YO GUYS. I finally did the thing. Got a simple myPHPAdmin backend hooked up to a front end called spaceBase that I use pretty frequently.

## Things ya need, dawg
- Download [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/). Great tool for running databases easily locally.

- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/install). This sweet tool helps us manage our code with ease. Watching and compiling all our stuff in a single place. Get it with Node by running via your Terminal or CMD `npm install -g sass`

## Quick Start

- Open MAMP and go to it's preferences (IDK what this would be in windows, sorry doods) and select the **Web Server** tab.
- After that, direct the document root to the root of this repo you cloned.
- Go back to the main MAMP thing and click **Start Servers**
- Next, click **install.php**. This includes the things you need to get your databases loaded.
- Lastly, go into our **public** directory, this is where our homepage will be with all dat CRUD functionality.  

## Editing HTML and SCSS/CSS

- Awhhllright this is where SASS comes in. Open your Terminal/CMD and navigate to the pubilc directory and run `sass --watch scss:css`, simple as that!

- I'll go over spaceBase with you guys in person cuz it's a bit much to put in a single read me. If you wanna brush up on it, you can [here](https://github.com/space150/spaceBase), but not sure what'll make sense to you and what won't.

## Any Questions?

- Shove it.
- Haha jk just hit me up and I'll get ya where ya need to be. Thanks guys!
